# Novalia

Novalia is an experiment in creating a grid-based strategy game.

Written in C#, using SadConsole 9 for GUI and tile graphics, and GoRogue 3 for map utilities.

## Compiling

Relies on the unreleased [TheSadRogue.Integration](https://github.com/thesadrogue/TheSadRogue.Integration). You'll have to clone it manually to compile for now (will be nugetized soon).
