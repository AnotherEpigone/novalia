# Novalia

Novalia is an experiment in creating a grid-based strategy game.

Written in C#, using SadConsole 9 for GUI and tile graphics, and GoRogue 3 for map utilities.

## Compiling

Relies on the unreleased [TheSadRogue.Integration](https://github.com/thesadrogue/TheSadRogue.Integration). Currently I'm relying on a workaround for an existing [issue](https://github.com/thesadrogue/TheSadRogue.Integration/issues/53), so you'll have to use this [branch](https://github.com/thesadrogue/TheSadRogue.Integration/tree/fix-map-with-child-renderer) to compile.
